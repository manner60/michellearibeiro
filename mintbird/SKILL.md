# MintBird Skill

**🎯 TRIGGER:** `/sales offer`, `/sales page`, `/funnel`

**⚡ EXECUTION STYLE:** Complete workflows with products linked

---

## Critical MintBird Rule

**EVERY sales page, upsell, downsell, or funnel step MUST:**
1. Have a **product created**
2. Have that **product linked to the page**

**NEVER skip product creation + linking.**

---

## Commands

### 1. `/sales offer` ⭐ NEW

**Purpose:** Create a complete sales page with product and checkout (enhanced workflow)

**STEP 1: Get the Big Idea/Hook**

**Ask:** "What's the big idea/hook for this offer?"

*(User provides the hook/angle)*

**STEP 2: Order Form Type**

**Ask:** "Do you want:
- **Button** that goes to checkout
- **Order Form** embedded on the page"

**STEP 3: If Order Form Selected**

**Ask:** "One Step or Two Step order form?"

*(One Step = all fields on one page, Two Step = email first, then details)*

**STEP 4: Generate Everything**

**Then automatically:**
1. **Generate Product Name** — Based on the hook (creates compelling name)
2. **Generate Sales Page** via AI with:
   - `is_orderform`: `true` or `false` (based on choice)
   - `orderform_step`: `"one"` or `"two"` (if order form selected)
3. **Create URL Slug** — Auto-generate from product name (e.g., "TikTok Cash System" → `tiktok-cash`)
4. **Use Domain:** Michelle's selected MintBird domain (fetch current domain list first; do not assume a hardcoded domain)
5. **Create Product** in MintBird:
   - Name from generated name
   - Price (ask if not clear from context)
   - Type: "digital"
   - Payment: Michelle's connected payment account (confirm provider + integration ID first)
6. **Link Product** to sales page via `/sales-pages/link-product`

**STEP 5: Return Results**

```
✅ SALES OFFER CREATED!

Product: [Generated Name]
Price: $[amount]

Sales Page: https://chadnicely.com/[slug]
Checkout: https://chadnicely.com/[slug]/checkout (or embedded)

Product ID: [id]
Page ID: [id]
```

**Example:**
```
User: /sales offer
Me: What's the big idea/hook?
User: Help people make money with TikTok without dancing
Me: Button or Order Form on page?
User: Order Form
Me: One Step or Two Step?
User: Two Step
Me: [generates "TikTok Silent Profit System", creates page with 2-step form, creates product, links them]
Me: ✅ Product: TikTok Silent Profit System
   Sales Page: https://chadnicely.com/tiktok-silent-profit
   Checkout: Embedded 2-step
```

---

### 3. `/sales page`

**Purpose:** Create, duplicate, replace, or insert content into a sales page

**STEP 0: Ask Action Type**

**Ask:** "What would you like to do?
- **Create** — Create a new sales page from scratch
- **Duplicate** — Make a copy of an existing page
- **Replace** — Replace/update an existing page entirely
- **Insert** — Insert new content into an existing page"

**Based on choice:**

**If CREATE:**
- Continue to Step 1 (Order Form Questions)

**If DUPLICATE:**
- Ask: "What's the ID or URL of the page you want to duplicate?"
- Ask: "What should the new page name be?"
- Use `GET /sales-pages/{id}` to fetch existing page
- Create new page with same content but new name/slug
- Return new page URL

**If REPLACE:**
- Ask: "What's the ID or URL of the page you want to replace?"
- Ask: "What changes do you want to make?"
- Delete old page or update in place
- Generate new content based on specifications
- Return updated page URL

**If INSERT:**
- Ask: "What's the ID or URL of the existing page?"
- Ask: "What content do you want to insert?"
- Ask: "Where should it go? (top, bottom, or replace specific section)"
- Fetch existing page, modify content, update via API
- Return updated page URL

**STEP 1: Ask Order Form Questions (for CREATE only)**

1. **"Do you want to add an Order Form to the sales page?"** (Yes/No)
2. **If Yes:** "How many steps should the Order Form have?" (One Step/Two Steps)

**STEP 2: Get Product Details**

Ask for:
- Product name
- Target audience
- Result/benefit
- Price

**STEP 3: Generate Sales Page**

**API Parameters:**
- `prompt`: Product description
- `name`: Product name
- `sub_type`: "salespage"
- `is_orderform`: `true` or `false`
- `orderform_step`: `"one"` or `"two"` (if is_orderform = true)

**Logic:**
- No → `is_orderform = false`
- Yes + One Step → `is_orderform = true`, `orderform_step = "one"`
- Yes + Two Steps → `is_orderform = true`, `orderform_step = "two"`

**STEP 4: Create Product (MANDATORY)**

After sales page is generated:
1. Create product via `POST /products`:
   - Body: `{name, description, price, type: "digital", payment_provider: "YOUR_PROVIDER", payment_integration_id: YOUR_PAYMENT_INTEGRATION_ID}`
   - Always use Michelle's connected payment account, not a hardcoded default
2. Link product to sales page via `POST /sales-pages/link-product`:
   - Body: `{sales_page_id, product_id, payment_option_type: "dropdown", is_one_time_payment: 1}`
3. Return: Sales page URL + Order form URL

**Example:**
```
User: /sales page
Me: Do you want to add an Order Form? (Yes/No)
User: Yes
Me: One Step or Two Steps?
User: One Step
Me: What's the product name?
User: TikTok Growth System
Me: [generates page, creates product, links them]
Me: ✅ Sales Page: https://...
   Order Form: https://...
```

### 4. `/funnel`

**Purpose:** Create a complete sales funnel with multiple pages

**PHASE 1 — Main Offer Setup**

**STEP 1:** Ask "What's the big idea/hook for this offer?"

**STEP 2:** Ask "Do you want:
1. **Button** that goes to checkout
2. **Order Form** embedded on the page"

**STEP 3:** If Order Form selected, ask "One Step or Two Step order form?"

**STEP 4:** Generate automatically:
1. **Product Name** — Create compelling name from hook
2. **Sales Page** — Generate via AI with:
   - `is_orderform`: `true` or `false` (based on choice)
   - `orderform_step`: `"one"` or `"two"` (if order form)
3. **URL Slug** — Auto-generate from product name
4. **Domain** — Use Michelle's selected MintBird domain (fetch available domains first)
5. **Product** — Create in MintBird:
   - Name from generated name
   - Price (ask if not clear)
   - Type: "digital"
6. **Link** — Connect product to sales page

**Payment Setup:** Use Michelle's connected payment account at funnel level after funnel creation. Confirm `payment_provider`, `payment_integration_id`, and `account_name` before creating paid products.

**PHASE 2 — Upsells**

**STEP 5:** Ask "How many upsells do you want?"

**STEP 6:** Look at original offer → Create **consistent & congruent** upsells:
- Must logically extend the main offer
- Same niche/topic
- Higher price (Upsell #1 < Upsell #2 < Upsell #3)

**STEP 7:** Wait for approval on upsells

**PHASE 3 — Build Everything**

**STEP 8:** Once approved, execute all at once:
1. Generate all upsell pages via AI (simultaneously)
2. Create products for each upsell
3. Link products to upsell pages
4. Create funnel container
5. Connect all pages as funnel steps
6. **Set Payment Provider** — Configure Michelle's connected payment account at funnel level for all products (do not use a hardcoded default)

**PHASE 4 — Simple Report**

Return clean summary:
```
✅ FUNNEL COMPLETE!

Product: [Name]
Price: $[amount]
URL: https://chadnicely.com/[slug]

Upsell #1: [Name] — $[amount]
Upsell #2: [Name] — $[amount]

Funnel ID: [id]
Payment: Michelle's connected payment account
```

**When suggesting upsells:**
- If they want 2 → suggest 2 options
- If they want 3 → suggest 3 options
- **Prices MUST increase** (Upsell #1 < Upsell #2 < Upsell #3)

**Upsell Suggestion Format:**
```
---

### **UPSELL #1**

**Name:** [Name]

**What it helps:**  
[Description]

**Price:** $[amount]

---

### **UPSELL #2**

**Name:** [Name]

**What it helps:**  
[Description]

**Price:** $[amount]

---
```

**After suggestions approved:**
- **BUILD ALL UPSELLS AT ONCE** (not one at a time)
- Generate all pages via API simultaneously
- Create products for each
- Link products to each upsell page
- Return ALL URLs

**PHASE 4 — Create Funnel Container & Connect Pages**

**Step 1: Create the funnel container:**
```powershell
$funnelBody = @{
    name = "[Funnel Name]"
    description = "[Description]"
} | ConvertTo-Json

$funnel = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.poplinks.io/api/ai/sales-funnels" -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $funnelBody
$funnelId = $funnel.data.sales_funnel.id
```

**Step 2: Add pages as funnel steps:**
```powershell
# Step 1: Sales Page
$step1 = @{
    sales_page_id = [sales_page_id]
    step_type = "sales_page"
    name = "[Step Name]"
} | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.poplinks.io/api/ai/sales-funnels/$funnelId/steps" -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $step1

# Step 2: Upsell  
$step2 = @{
    sales_page_id = [upsell_page_id]
    step_type = "upsell"
    name = "[Step Name]"
} | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.poplinks.io/api/ai/sales-funnels/$funnelId/steps" -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $step2
```

**FUNNEL COMPLETE!**

**Example:**
```
User: /funnel
Me: [Stage 1 questions]
User: [answers]
Me: Summary approved?
User: Yes
Me: [generates sales page]
Me: How many upsells?
User: 2
Me: [suggests 2 upsells]
User: Good
Me: [builds everything, creates products, links them, creates funnel container]
Me: ✅ Funnel Complete!
   Sales Page → $27
   Upsell #1 → $67
   Upsell #2 → $197
```

## Critical Rules

1. **ALWAYS create product** (can't skip)
2. **ALWAYS link product** to page (or checkout won't work)
3. **Poll for AI generation** (60-120 seconds typical)
4. **Get approval** between phases
5. **Build upsells all at once** (not one by one)
